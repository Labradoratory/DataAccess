# Fetch
Fetch is a base implementation of the [repository pattern](https://www.google.com/search?q=repository+pattern) that includes a processing pipeline for extending the functionality of a respository.  This library also includes entity change tracking to support the pipeline system and base controller implementations to get service implementations off the ground quickly.

## Repository 
The `Repository` class is the base implementation that all repository instances should inherit from.  It provides the very basic operations including Get, Add, Update and Delete.  

*TODO: more info*

## Processor Pipeline


*This is a work in progress.  Will update documentation when usable.*
